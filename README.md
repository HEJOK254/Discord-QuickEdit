# Discord QuickEdit

QuickEdit is an open-source Discord bot written in C# using the [Discord.NET library](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net). It is currently a work in progress and not yet ready for use.

If you want to help develop this bot, and speed up it's release, check out [Contributing](#contributing)!

I might host and publish the bot later on in the development, when the app is actually usable. For now, I'm just hosting it for a few of my friends and myself, and using a different bot account for when I'm testing it out and working on it.

## IMPORTANT

You are currently NOT ALLOWED to use this project, as I haven't yet given it a license yet.\
(You can still contribute)

## Features

- Video Trimming - Trim your videos with `/video trim`!
- Video & Image Converter - Convert your Images or Videos into different formats with `/file convert`!

That's it for now lol, but more are planned (like the "jpegify" command)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!\
If you've never contributed to a GitHub repo before, you can check out [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) I guess.

I'm not specifying any guidelines, because I have no idea how to write or create good guidelines.

If you have any questions, create an issue or something, and I'll try to respond.

## License

This project currently does NOT have a license. I am planning to add it in the future. (I kind of got stuck choosing one :/)

If you know a bit about software licenses, and want to help, you can open an issue and help me choose one! :D

## ToDo

The todo for the project is generally just the [issues](https://github.com/HEJOK254/Discord-QuickEdit/issues) + the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/HEJOK254/projects/8).
